   - **Route53:** DNS configuration for the bastion host

### 3. Network Infrastructure Setup

#### Create Default VPC (if needed)
1. Navigate to: [VPC Console - Create Default VPC](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-2#CreateDefaultVpc:)
2. Click **"Create Default VPC"**
3. Wait for creation to complete

## Bastion Host Configuration

### 1. Launch EC2 Instance

#### Instance Configuration
1. In the EC2 Console, click **"Launch instance"**
2. Use the wizard to configure the following settings:

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `bastion` | Descriptive name for identification |
| **OS** | Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 | Latest stable RHEL version |
| **Instance Type** | `t2.large` | Minimum for mirroring operations |
| **Key Pair** | Create new or select existing | Download and save securely |
| **Network** | Default VPC and subnet | Use previously created Default VPC |
| **Storage** | 1x 1024 GiB (gp3) | Required for mirroring operations |

3. Click **"Launch instance"**

### 2. Security Group Configuration, only needed to access your registry externally

Configure inbound rule to allow access to mirror registry:

1. **Select your bastion instance** from the EC2 console
2. Navigate to the **"Security"** tab
3. **Click on the currently applied Security Group** link (usually `launch-wizard-1`)
4. Click **"Edit inbound rules"**
5. Click **"Add rule"** and use the following settings:
   - **Type:** Custom TCP
   - **Port Range:** 8443
   - **Source:** 0.0.0.0/0 (for lab/testing only - restrict in production)
6. Click **"Save Rules"**

### 3. Connect to Bastion Host

#### SSH Connection
```bash
# Replace with your actual key file and IP address
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@[BASTION-PUBLIC-IP]

# Alternative: Use the public DNS name (after DNS configuration)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@bastion.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com
```

### 4. Initial System Setup (Bastion)

Once connected to your bastion host, perform initial configuration:

```bash
# Set the hostname (replace XXX with your sandbox number)
sudo hostnamectl hostname bastion.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com

# Install required packages
sudo dnf install -y podman git jq vim wget

# Verify installation
podman --version
git --version
```

## Registry Host Configuration

### 1. Launch Registry EC2 Instance

Create a second EC2 instance identical to the bastion host for registry operations:

#### Instance Configuration
1. In the EC2 Console, click **"Launch instance"**
2. Use the wizard to configure the following settings:

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Name** | `registry` | Descriptive name for registry operations |
| **OS** | Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 | Same as bastion host |
| **Instance Type** | `t2.large` | Same specifications as bastion |
| **Key Pair** | Use same key pair as bastion | For consistent access |
| **Network** | Default VPC and subnet | Same network as bastion host |
| **Storage** | 1x 1024 GiB (gp3) | Same storage as bastion for registry data |

3. Click **"Launch instance"**



### 3. Connect to Registry Host

#### SSH Connection
```bash
# Replace with your actual key file and IP address
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@[REGISTRY-PUBLIC-IP]

# Alternative: Use the public DNS name (after DNS configuration)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@registry.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com
```

### 4. Initial System Setup (Registry)

Once connected to your registry host, perform initial configuration:

```bash
# Set the hostname (replace XXX with your sandbox number)
sudo hostnamectl hostname registry.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com

# Install required packages
sudo dnf install -y podman git jq vim wget

# Verify installation
podman --version
git --version
```

## DNS Configuration

Set up DNS records for both bastion and registry hosts:

### 1. Create Bastion DNS Record

1. **Copy the public IP address** from your bastion EC2 instance details
2. **Navigate to the Route53 console**
3. **Click Hosted zones from the sidebar menu**
4. **Select your hosted zone** (e.g. `sandboxXXX.opentlc.com`)
5. **Click "Create record" and use the following settings**:
   - **Record Name:** `bastion`
   - **Record Type:** A
   - **Value:** [Your bastion EC2 instance's public IP]
6. **Click "Create records"**

### 2. Create Registry DNS Record

1. **Copy the public IP address** from your registry EC2 instance details
2. **In the same hosted zone**, click **"Create record"** again
3. **Use the following settings**:
   - **Record Name:** `registry`
   - **Record Type:** A
   - **Value:** [Your registry EC2 instance's public IP]
4. **Click "Create records"**

### 3. Verify DNS Configuration

```bash
# Test DNS resolution for both hosts
nslookup bastion.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com
nslookup registry.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com

# Alternative: Use dig command
dig +short bastion.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com
dig +short registry.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com
```

### 4. Ensure registry instance is in a simulated disconnected environment

1. **Copy the public IP address** from your bastion EC2 instance details
2. **Navigate to the EC2 console**
3. **Click 'registry' instance id in the center view**
4. **Click the 'Security' tab**
5. **Scroll down to 'Outbound' rules and click the rule (probably launch-wizard-2)**
6. **Click the security group id in the center view**
7. **Edit the existing outbound rule to only allow 'All traffic' and paste the bastion EC2 ip address from above**
8. **The registry instance can now only communicate with the bastion EC2 instance**

> ⚠️ **Important:** Connectivity of registry can be restored by changing the allowed box back to `0.0.0.0/0` 

## Next Steps

## AWS-Specific Notes

### Cost Management
- **Two t2.large instances** and **2TB total storage** (2x1TB) will incur higher costs
- Use the demo environment's auto-stop/auto-destroy features for both instances
- Monitor usage through the AWS billing dashboard
- Consider stopping instances when not in use for extended periods

### Security Considerations
- Security group rule (0.0.0.0/0) is for lab use only
- In production, restrict source IPs to specific networks
- **Registry host** should have additional security hardening in production environments
- Consider using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for SSH access to both hosts

### Network Architecture
- Both hosts share the same VPC and security group for simplicity
- In production, consider separate subnets or security groups for role isolation
- DNS names (`bastion.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com` and `registry.sandboxXXX.opentlc.com`) provide clear host identification

### Troubleshooting
- If EC2 launch fails, check service limits in the AWS console (now using 2 instances)
- Route53 DNS propagation may take 5-10 minutes for both records
- Ensure your SSH key has proper permissions (chmod 600) and works with both hosts
- Test connectivity between bastion and registry hosts if using internal networking
